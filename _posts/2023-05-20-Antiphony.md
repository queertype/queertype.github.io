Antiphony is a type family that explores typographic extremes and orchestrates commonalities through opposites. It's a dualistic system that challenges the viewer as well as traditional models for typographic systems. 

For my TypeMedia final project, I knew I wanted to do something extreme and unusual. Since my projects in the first semester were more traditional or by the books, I wanted to utilize everything I learned thus far and apply it to a personal project that pushed boundaries.

Because of the extreme angle of the forward and reverse italics, Antiphony is suitable for setting type at 45Â° in either direction. Additionally, the fluid nature of the design allows naturally setting the type on curved paths. The Antiphony type family contains 2 Display Italic styles, 2 Display Contra-Italic styles, and 2 Heading styles.

Antiphony was conceived during the TypeMedia MA Type Design program at the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague. It is currently in development, but you can contact me for trial fonts.

This typeface was developed during the TypeMedia Master's program, as an exercise in contrast. Emphasis was placed on matching the typeface across regular contrast, low contrast, and a high contrast black weight. Additionally, I developed Cyrillic for the low and high contrast styles during a Cyrillic workshop with Ilya Ruderman. I'll find the right name for it someday, I promise!

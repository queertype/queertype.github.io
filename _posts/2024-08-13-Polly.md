Polly was developed during the Type@Cooper Extended Program class of 2021, and inspired by the music and persona of Betsy's favorite musician. It's a confident and sharp sans-serif with a broad-nib influence, intended for setting lyrics in record sleeves, or other texts related to music. Polly includes a Regular, Italic, Bold, and Bold Italic.
